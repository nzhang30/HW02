## Graph 1: Graph of Population China (2002-2013)
![Line Graph of China Popoulation from 2002-2013](https://github.com/nzhang30/HW02/blob/main/population_china.jpg).

This graph of China population since 1900 highlights the high population growth that China experienced within the first decade of the 20th century. Between 2002 and 2013, China's population grew around 6.5%, with a total population of 1.36 Billion in 2013.

Data on Population of China per year can be found [here](https://github.com/antvis/data-set/blob/master/test/fixtures/population-china.csv).


## Graph 2: Comparing Population Density of Different Regions of Africa (2019)

Population density is an important measure of settlement intensity across a specific geographic region. It tells us the average measurement of population in a given area. Population density is a measurement of population per unit area, or exceptionally unit volume; it is a quantity of type number density. This graph allows me to compare the population density of the various regions of the African continent. 

Data on countries' population, density, and other metrics may be found here [here](https://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/PDFs/SYB63_1_202105_Population,%20Surface%20Area,%20Density.pdf).
